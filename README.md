Larry Seyer (rhymes with FIRE) is a musician who plays guitar and sings.

Every Thursday at 7PM Central Time, he hosts “The Larry Seyer Show”, a live video event featuring music, jokes, education, and other entertainment.

From 1986 through 2007, Larry engineered almost all of the ‘Asleep At The Wheel‘ recordings produced during that time period. Doing so won him several Grammy Awards and Platinum records.


In addition to producing and engineering, Larry has scored original music for eight (8) motion pictures as well as national TV shows and documentaries and created music sample libraries.

A student of “A Course in Miracles” since 1988, he has helped many people find the Course. He also produced and recorded the audio for Regina Dawn Akers’s “The Holy Spirit’s Interpretation of the New Testament (NTI)“.

After moving to Hawaii in 2013 and playing music full time there, Larry is now back in Texas producing “The Larry Seyer Show” and shares his audio sample libraries on Pianobook.

In his spare time, he writes books based on ACIM principles. His first book “There’s Only ONE of Us Here – and it’s NOT you!” is a humorous discussion between two people about the nature of human existence. (also available as an eBook)
